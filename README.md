Reform B2Bi/EDI with Block Chain Technology to build a trust business enviroment

## Goal
From technical aspect view, the enterprise IT systems could be devided into two parts: Enterprise Internal system,such as ERP,CRM,HR and so on; And the data flow among enterprises(supply chain), normally it is called EDI(Electronic Data Interchange)/B2Bi(Business to Business Integration). The B2Bi is based on some protocols, such as AS2([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS2] Applicability Statement 2), OFTP([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFTP] Odette File Transfer Protocol),Rosettanet,etc.

This project try to build next generation of B2Bi protocl with last Block Chain technology to replace the current B2Bi protocols. The defects of current protocols will be overcome and the Block Chain benifit will be gained.

## Current B2Bi protocols
AS2 is the most polular protocol, so the the analysis below is based on AS2. AS2 have implements the blow features:
* Security
* reliability
* Integrity
* Non repudiation

Key technologies of AS2 are Asymmetric encryption,digital certificate,encryption/decryption, digital signature and MDN(Message Delivery Notification).

Althgouth AS2 is good and polular, it still has issues below
